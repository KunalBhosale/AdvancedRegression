# Project Name
The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.
You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

## General Information
Build a advanced regression model to find out which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
How well those variables describe the price of a house.

You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns.
